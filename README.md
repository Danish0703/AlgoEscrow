# ‚ú® AlgoZKP: Unleash Privacy on Algorand ‚ú®


What if you could prove something on the blockchain without revealing *everything*? What if your dApp could verify user credentials, eligibility, or votes while guaranteeing absolute privacy?

**Enter AlgoZKP.**

AlgoZKP is a developer-friendly, open-source toolkit that brings the power of **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to the Algorand blockchain. It's a foundational piece of infrastructure designed to make building private, scalable, and secure dApps easier than ever.

## \#\# üö´ The Problem: The Paradox of the Public Blockchain

Public blockchains offer incredible transparency, but this is a double-edged sword. Every interaction is public, creating major hurdles for applications that handle sensitive data:

  * **Identity üÜî:** How can a user prove they're over 18 without revealing their birthdate?
  * **DeFi üí∞:** How can a user prove their creditworthiness without disclosing their entire financial history?
  * **Governance ü§´:** How can DAOs conduct truly secret ballots, free from voter coercion, while still ensuring eligibility?

-----

## \#\# ‚úÖ The Solution: Your Gateway to Privacy

**AlgoZKP is your gateway to privacy.** It's a modular SDK and a set of highly-optimized smart contracts that abstract away the complex cryptography of ZKPs. By leveraging the latest **AVM upgrades** (specifically the `ec_pairing_verify` opcode), we make on-chain ZKP verification efficient and affordable on Algorand.

## \#\# üöÄ Key Features

  * **üß© Modular & Reusable:** A clean SDK (TypeScript/Python) and on-chain primitives that can be easily integrated into any Algorand dApp.
  * **‚ö° Optimized On-Chain Verifier:** A hyper-optimized PyTeal/TEAL smart contract that minimizes opcode costs for ZKP verification, making privacy practical.
  * **üåê Universal ZKP Scheme:** Built with support for **Plonk**, a modern ZKP system that doesn't require a per-circuit trusted setup, making it incredibly flexible for developers.
  * **üßë‚Äçüíª Built for Developers:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with the **AlgoKit** ecosystem, providing a familiar and powerful development experience.

## \#\# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

AlgoZKP simplifies the complex ZKP workflow into three distinct steps:

1.  **Define (Off-Chain):** A developer defines a "circuit" representing the statement to be proven (e.g., "I know a secret that hashes to a known value"). This is done using a language like **Circom**.
2.  **Prove (Off-Chain):** A user, with their private data, uses the AlgoZKP SDK to generate a small, cryptographic proof. This happens entirely on the client-side, preserving privacy.
3.  **Verify (On-Chain):** The user submits this proof to the AlgoZKP Verifier smart contract. The contract verifies the proof's validity **without ever seeing the user's private data**. If valid, the transaction succeeds.

## \#\# üèÅ Getting Started

### \#\#\# Prerequisites

  * [AlgoKit](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli) v1.7.0+
  * Node.js v18+
  * Docker

### \#\#\# Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/algozkp.git
cd algozkp

# 2. Install dependencies using AlgoKit
algokit bootstrap all
```

### \#\#\# Quick Example: Using the SDK

Here's how a developer might use the SDK to generate and verify a simple proof.

```typescript
import { AlgoZKP } from './sdk';
import { myAppClient } from './clients'; // Your AlgoKit-generated client

// 1. Initialize the toolkit
const zkp = new AlgoZKP();
const userSecret = 'my-secret-password';
const knownHash = '...'; // The public hash to prove against

// 2. Generate the proof off-chain
console.log('Generating proof...');
const { proof, publicInputs } = await zkp.generateProof('hash-preimage', { secret: userSecret }, { hash: knownHash });

// 3. Verify the proof on-chain
console.log('Verifying proof on Algorand...');
const result = await myAppClient.verify(proof, publicInputs);

if (result) {
  console.log('‚úÖ Proof verified successfully!');
}
```
