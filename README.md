# ✨ AlgoZKP: Unleash Privacy on Algorand ✨


What if you could prove something on the blockchain without revealing *everything*? What if your dApp could verify user credentials, eligibility, or votes while guaranteeing absolute privacy?

**Enter AlgoZKP.**

AlgoZKP is a developer-friendly, open-source toolkit that brings the power of **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to the Algorand blockchain. It's a foundational piece of infrastructure designed to make building private, scalable, and secure dApps easier than ever.

## 🚫 The Problem: The Paradox of the Public Blockchain

Public blockchains offer incredible transparency, but this is a double-edged sword. Every interaction is public, creating major hurdles for applications that handle sensitive data:

  * **Identity 🆔:** How can a user prove they're over 18 without revealing their birthdate?
  * **DeFi 💰:** How can a user prove their creditworthiness without disclosing their entire financial history?
  * **Governance 🤫:** How can DAOs conduct truly secret ballots, free from voter coercion, while still ensuring eligibility?

##  ✅ The Solution: Your Gateway to Privacy

**AlgoZKP is your gateway to privacy.** It's a modular SDK and a set of highly-optimized smart contracts that abstract away the complex cryptography of ZKPs. By leveraging the latest **AVM upgrades** (specifically the `ec_pairing_verify` opcode), we make on-chain ZKP verification efficient and affordable on Algorand.

## 🚀 Key Features

  * **🧩 Modular & Reusable:** A clean SDK (TypeScript/Python) and on-chain primitives that can be easily integrated into any Algorand dApp.
  * **⚡ Optimized On-Chain Verifier:** A hyper-optimized PyTeal/TEAL smart contract that minimizes opcode costs for ZKP verification, making privacy practical.
  * **🌐 Universal ZKP Scheme:** Built with support for **Plonk**, a modern ZKP system that doesn't require a per-circuit trusted setup, making it incredibly flexible for developers.
  * **🧑‍💻 Built for Developers:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with the **AlgoKit** ecosystem, providing a familiar and powerful development experience.

##  ⚙️ How It Works

AlgoZKP simplifies the complex ZKP workflow into three distinct steps:

1.  **Define (Off-Chain):** A developer defines a "circuit" representing the statement to be proven (e.g., "I know a secret that hashes to a known value"). This is done using a language like **Circom**.
2.  **Prove (Off-Chain):** A user, with their private data, uses the AlgoZKP SDK to generate a small, cryptographic proof. This happens entirely on the client-side, preserving privacy.
3.  **Verify (On-Chain):** The user submits this proof to the AlgoZKP Verifier smart contract. The contract verifies the proof's validity **without ever seeing the user's private data**. If valid, the transaction succeeds.
