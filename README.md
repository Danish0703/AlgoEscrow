# AlgoEscrow

Welcome to your new AlgoKit project!

This is your workspace root. A `workspace` in AlgoKit is an orchestrated collection of standalone projects (backends, smart contracts, frontend apps and etc).

By default, `projects_root_path` parameter is set to `projects`. Which instructs AlgoKit CLI to create a new directory under `projects` directory when new project is instantiated via `algokit init` at the root of the workspace.

## Getting Started

To get started refer to `README.md` files in respective sub-projects in the `projects` directory.

To learn more about algokit, visit [documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/algokit.md).

### GitHub Codespaces

To get started execute:

1. `algokit generate devcontainer` - invoking this command from the root of this repository will create a `devcontainer.json` file with all the configuration needed to run this project in a GitHub codespace. [Run the repository inside a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) to get started.
2. `algokit init` - invoke this command inside a github codespace to launch an interactive wizard to guide you through the process of creating a new AlgoKit project

# ✨ AlgoZKP: Unleash Privacy on Algorand ✨


What if you could prove something on the blockchain without revealing *everything*? What if your dApp could verify user credentials, eligibility, or votes while guaranteeing absolute privacy?

**Enter AlgoZKP.**

AlgoZKP is a developer-friendly, open-source toolkit that brings the power of **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to the Algorand blockchain. It's a foundational piece of infrastructure designed to make building private, scalable, and secure dApps easier than ever.

-----

## 🚫 The Problem: The Paradox of the Public Blockchain

Public blockchains offer incredible transparency, but this is a double-edged sword. Every interaction is public, creating major hurdles for applications that handle sensitive data:

  * **Identity 🆔:** How can a user prove they're over 18 without revealing their birthdate?
  * **DeFi 💰:** How can a user prove their creditworthiness without disclosing their entire financial history?
  * **Governance 🤫:** How can DAOs conduct truly secret ballots, free from voter coercion, while still ensuring eligibility?

-----

##  ✅ The Solution: Your Gateway to Privacy

**AlgoZKP is your gateway to privacy.** It's a modular SDK and a set of highly-optimized smart contracts that abstract away the complex cryptography of ZKPs. By leveraging the latest **AVM upgrades** (specifically the `ec_pairing_verify` opcode), we make on-chain ZKP verification efficient and affordable on Algorand.

-----

## 🚀 Key Features

  * **🧩 Modular & Reusable:** A clean SDK (TypeScript/Python) and on-chain primitives that can be easily integrated into any Algorand dApp.
  * **⚡ Optimized On-Chain Verifier:** A hyper-optimized PyTeal/TEAL smart contract that minimizes opcode costs for ZKP verification, making privacy practical.
  * **🌐 Universal ZKP Scheme:** Built with support for **Plonk**, a modern ZKP system that doesn't require a per-circuit trusted setup, making it incredibly flexible for developers.
  * **🧑‍💻 Built for Developers:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with the **AlgoKit** ecosystem, providing a familiar and powerful development experience.

-----

##  ⚙️ How It Works

AlgoZKP simplifies the complex ZKP workflow into three distinct steps:

1.  **Define (Off-Chain):** A developer defines a "circuit" representing the statement to be proven (e.g., "I know a secret that hashes to a known value"). This is done using a language like **Circom**.
2.  **Prove (Off-Chain):** A user, with their private data, uses the AlgoZKP SDK to generate a small, cryptographic proof. This happens entirely on the client-side, preserving privacy.
3.  **Verify (On-Chain):** The user submits this proof to the AlgoZKP Verifier smart contract. The contract verifies the proof's validity **without ever seeing the user's private data**. If valid, the transaction succeeds.

##  🛠️ Tech Stack

  * **Blockchain:** **Algorand**
  * **Smart Contracts:** **PyTeal**, **TEAL**, **Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM)**
  * **ZK Circuits:** **Circom**
  * **Proof Generation:** **snarkjs** (compiled to WASM for browser use)
  * **SDK & Tooling:** **TypeScript**, **Python**, **AlgoKit**
